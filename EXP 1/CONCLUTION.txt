This lab was about creating circuits in Logisim that could show decimal numbers on seven-segment displays by using binary inputs. Additionally, we were able to translate between the binary system and the decimal system, construct logical gates for various combinations in order to control more than one display as well as its practical experience has given us a better insight into digital fundamentals about processors.The Logisim simulator helps us design and test efficient circuits, enabling us to understand how they work without needing any physical components.
